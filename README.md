# Oxford AI Society: PyTorch Study Group
We are part of the [Oxford AI Society](https://www.facebook.com/oxaisoc/), and we meet every week to learn and practice using PyTorch, a machine learning library for Python that can be used for image classification, reinforcement learning, and neural networks. 

## Quick links
* [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/566762303704780/) has all meeting times and venues 
* [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15eGZ52ccQmZrHfkA0YGIUClKb1xle7t-fXYBRO-X5rg/view) contains useful resources and project ideas.
* [Official PyTorch Tutorials](http://pytorch.org/tutorials/)
* [PyTorch documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.1/) -- if you see an unfamiliar pytorch function this is the place to figure out what it does

## Using this repository
This repository is meant to help us work together on projects and for you to share code that seems problematic or interesting. You will have to [install git]() and I would recommend [this quick tutorial](https://try.github.io/) to get familiar with it. 
To copy material to your desktop use:
.. code:: shell

	  git clone https://github.com/MaksymPetyak/OxAIPyTorch
