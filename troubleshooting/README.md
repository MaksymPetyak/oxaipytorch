# Troubleshooting
If you are feeling stuck on some project, copy it to a folder with your name and push changes, this way other members of the study group can help you analyse the code.
For example, in maksym/EasyGenerative.ipynb one of the functions seems confusing so I put comment saying **QUESTION** above, so that it should be easy for others to find, and post it here for everyone to see. 
```python
# QUESTION: what does this function do?
def decorate_with_diffs(data, exponent):
    ...
```
